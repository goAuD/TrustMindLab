A curated collection of practical notes, guides, and troubleshooting logs related to pfSense-based firewall engineering and hardening. This is a part of the broader **TrustMindLab** infrastructure lab focused on real-world deployments, system thinking, and security-first practices.

---

## Overview

This directory contains hands-on documentation covering:

- Firewall and NAT design
- Performance tuning on lowâ€‘end hardware
- Disaster recovery strategies
- System monitoring and logging issues
- Optimization of pfSense packages and resources
- Creative configuration scenarios with scripts and tealogs

Each document reflects a piece of actual experimentation and hard-earned insight â€” not theory.

## Best Practices & Inspiration

Drawing on community and vendor documentationâ€”especially Netgate's official guideâ€”I focus on principles like:

- **Default deny** workflow: only allow what is necessary, let pfSense drop the rest by default. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- Use **descriptive rule names** and comment fields to keep the firewall logic transparent. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- Regular **configuration audits** to align rules with actual security posture. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- **Hardening routines**: updating defaults, eliminating UI access from WAN, enforcing two-factor auth etc. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  

These files in this directory serve the same intentâ€”documenting not what could be done, but what **was done**, how, and why.

## How to Navigate

1. **Scan the filenames**: logical and date-suffixed, ready to consume one at a time.
2. **Start with your interest area**:
   - Recovery? â†’ Open `pfsense_disaster_recovery_guide.md`
   - Rule cleanup? â†’ `pfsense_firewall_audit_and_cleanup_2025_06_20.md`
   - Hardware quirks? â†’ `pfsense_usb_lan_adapter_power_stabilty_investigation.md`
3. **Look for internal diagrams**, screenshots, and `![Dashboard]` visuals in each file.
4. **Apply the changes as a personal baseline**, adapt â€” donâ€™t just copy.

## Why This Matters

TrustMindLab isnâ€™t a simulation â€” itâ€™s a **living lab**. Each pfSense note here is born out of:

- Real systems under real constraints
- Failures that taught lessons
- Reconfigurations that stuck

Use them, clone them, but above all â€” **learn from them**.
