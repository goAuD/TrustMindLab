## 💾 System Overview

- OS: Windows 11 Pro (fresh reinstall)

- RAM: 32 GB

- Drive: SSD (pagefile active)

- Usage: Plex server, remote media access (iPhone, Fedora), secure browsing, Tailscale VPN

---

## ⚙️ System Tweaks

Pagefile (Virtual Memory):

- Initial size: 1024 MB

- Maximum size: 4892 MB

- Located on SSD (system drive)

Default settings work fine with 32 GB RAM

---

## 🌐 Network Setup

- UPnP is enabled and helps both Plex and Tailscale

- NAT is enabled on the router — I finally understand how it translates local and public IPs

- I manually opened port 32400 for Plex, but with UPnP working I may not need it anymore

- SIP-ALG is still on by default, but since I turned off Wi-Fi Calling, I think I can safely disable it

- MAC/IP/Port Filtering is on by default and probably unnecessary — I plan to turn it off

- DMZ is not being used — I don't need it for this setup

---

## 🎥 Plex + Tailscale

Plex now shows a direct connection — the stream quality is much better and stable
Tailscale is amazing:

- My iPhone connects through an Exit Node when needed, depending on whether it's on Wi-Fi or mobile

- Plex works great over Tailscale without any issues

---

## 📒 Final Notes

Today I made great progress. Tailscale has proven to be fast, reliable, and simple to use.
Next steps:

- Try removing the manual port forward for Plex

- Disable SIP-ALG and MAC/IP/Port Filtering if everything still works

- Set up WireGuard or start experimenting with Docker

- Keep documenting everything in my GitHub repo
