# **Welcome, in my HomeLab Project!**

<summary><strong>  Introduction – Who I am and what this project is about</strong></summary>

---

My name is Viktor Halupka, I was born in Budapest, and I have been living in Austria since 2014.  
Since my childhood (Commodore 64), I have been interested in the world of IT, but I worked in the gastronomy industry for a long time.  
At the age of forty, however, I decided to make a dream come true: to work professionally with IT, networks, and servers.

This homelab project is the first step on that path: I am building a real, working test environment on my own budget and in my free time, in order to gain hands-on experience in system and network administration.

This is not a perfectly sterile lab, but rather a fine worked, dynamically evolving learning platform, with its own mistakes, solutions, and documentation.

### My goal with this project is to:  
- demonstrate my progress,
- build a stable, remotely accessible, container-based home service platform that also serves as a learning environment,  
- help other beginners who are starting a similar journey, and  
- convince my future employer that they are dealing with a motivated, eager-to-learn, and practical-minded person.

**It’s never too late to change direction – the only thing that matters is that you take the first step.**

<pre style="color:#FF4500; background-color:#1a1a1a; padding:1em; border-radius:10px; font-family:Consolas,Monaco,monospace;">
One Firewall to rule all them,
One DNS to find them,
One DHCP to bring them all,
And in the darkness bind them.

<p style="color:gray; font-style:italic;">
Tuned in the darkest corners of Mordor...

*A pfSense tale where NAT and DHCP rules reign supreme - and only one sysadmin apprentice stands between order and chaos.*

<sub><i>Status of my pfSense - minimal CPU load, low memory usage, and a KEA-powered DHCP. Yes, DNS Unbound still reigns supreme.</i></sub>



## Synopsis
This isn’t just a HomeLab project. This is an epic.

An old HP laptop, once forgotten, rises again – not as a client, but as a firewall.  
The hero's journey spans two interfaces: one toward the ISP, one into the heart of the LAN.  
Along the way, they face mythical entities such as `dhcpd`, the `pfctl` daemon, and the fearsome `nbound`.

## ⚔️ The Quest
- [x] Install pfSense on a 2017-ish laptop that wheezes under load
- [x] Configure WAN/LAN interfaces (with some reboot rituals)
- [x] Grant LAN devices access to the internet – *finally*
- [x] Explore the dark arts of port forwarding
- [x] Integrate Tailscale, Plex, DNS
- [ ] Never reinstall again (lol, sure...)

##  Network Topology (2025 Summer Edition)

### 1. ISP Router
- Acts as the upstream connection to the internet.
- Either in bridge mode or with DMZ pointing to pfSense.
- Connected via Ethernet to the pfSense WAN interface.

### 2. pfSense (running on an old laptop)
- Serves as the main router and firewall.
- Interfaces:
  - **WAN** → connected to ISP router.
  - **LAN** → connected to local network via a switch.
- Provides:
  - DHCP and DNS for the LAN.
  - NAT, port forwarding, and firewall rules.
  - Future plans: pfBlockerNG, Tailscale subnet routing.

### 3. LAN Switch
- Connected to the pfSense LAN port.
- Distributes LAN connectivity to wired devices and access points.

### 4. Devices connected to the switch
- **PC (Windows 11 Pro)**
  - Hosts Plex Media Server and PhotoPrism (via Docker/Portainer).
  - Also used for general administration and monitoring.
- **ZTE Router (WLAN Access Point Mode)**
  - Provides Wi-Fi only (DHCP disabled).
  - Connected via Ethernet to the switch.
    

### 5. Devices connected via Wi-Fi (through ZTE AP)
- Smartphones
- Tablets
- Smartwatch
- Nokia streaming box
- HP printer
- IoT gadgets

As part of the HomeLab, I used Docker containerization to host isolated, manageable home services. During the project, I resolved several technical issues and successfully deployed several services, including:

## Problem:

- Installed Docker and WSL2 on Windows 11, but the WSL2 initially failed to start due to misconfigured .wslconfig.

## 🔨Fixing WSL `automount` Configuration:

> **Note:** `crossDistro = true` is **not** a valid key in the `[automount]` section, so WSL throws an unknown key error if you include it.

####  Correct `[automount]` Configuration Example:

```ini
[automount]
root = /mnt/host
options = "metadata"
```

---

### Restarting WSL and Docker Container

After saving the correct `.wslconfig` file, restart WSL and the Docker container:

```powershell
wsl --shutdown
```

```powershell
wsl
```

```powershell
docker compose up -d
```

>  WSL2 should now run reliably, and Docker should successfully start the container.

## Problem:

- Docker Desktop Startup Issue on Windows
- When Docker Desktop is set to start automatically with Windows, the following issues occur:

1. **WSL Initialization Error**: On boot, Docker shows an error indicating that WSL is not loaded yet.
2. **Engine Startup Failure**: Shortly after, another message appears (e.g., *Fetching issue*), and the Docker engine does not become usable.
3. **Workaround Required**: Even if Docker Desktop is manually shut down, the issue persists unless further steps are taken.

## 🔨Solution:
### To get Docker Desktop working properly again:

1. Fully exit Docker Desktop (`Right-click → Quit Docker Desktop`).
2. Open `Event Viewer`, or alternatively use Task Manager or PowerShell.
3. Locate and terminate the `com.docker.build.exe` process.
4. Restart Docker Desktop manually.

## After performing these steps, Docker works normally.

### Suspected Cause
This may be due to **slow WSL initialization on system startup**, especially if Docker and/or WSL-related components are located on a **mechanical HDD**. The delayed loading could cause Docker to attempt to start before WSL is fully ready.

### Suggested Fix
Try moving Docker's WSL-related files and configuration (or the entire Docker installation) to a **solid-state drive (SSD)**. This might ensure faster startup and proper synchronization with WSL during boot.

> **Note:** WSL2 boot speed improved: confirmed SSD is significantly faster than HDD when hosting the virtual disk.

## Common Docker Commands with Explanations  
It will come in handy someday🙂

| Command                           | Description                                                                                 |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `docker compose up -d`            | Starts the containers defined in `docker-compose.yml` in detached (background) mode.        |
| `docker compose down`             | Stops and removes the containers, networks, and volumes created by `docker-compose up`.     |
| `docker compose restart`          | Restarts all containers defined in the compose file.                                        |
| `docker ps`                       | Lists all currently running containers.                                                     |

| `docker logs photoprism`          | Displays the logs/output from the container named `photoprism`. Useful for troubleshooting. |
| `docker exec -it photoprism bash` | Opens an interactive shell (`bash`) inside the running `photoprism` container.              |
| `docker stop photoprism`          | Gracefully stops the `photoprism` container.                                                |
| `docker start photoprism`         | Starts a stopped `photoprism` container.                                                    |
| `docker rm photoprism`            | Removes the `photoprism` container. It must be stopped first.                               |
| `docker images`                   | Lists all downloaded Docker images.                                                         |

## Finally some tests and settings

- Tailscale integration: successfully tested secure remote access to Docker containers (e.g., PhotoPrism) from mobile and Fedora machines

- PhotoPrism AI photo library: set up and secured using Tailscale + port forwarding. A private, smart photo library with AI-assisted organization

- Plex and Plexamp integration: music library is now securely available on mobile, even while commuting


## Planned next steps:

- Install Portainer: a web-based Docker management interface for easier container control

- Use Docker Compose: to manage multi-container setups (e.g., webserver + database)

- Further harden container access using Tailscale or WireGuard

- Reverse proxy setup planned: using Caddy or Nginx to simplify HTTPS and routing
