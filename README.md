## Introduction â€“ Who I am and what this project is about

My name is Viktor Halupka, I was born in Budapest, and I have been living in Austria since 2014.  
Since my childhood (Commodore 64), I have been interested in the world of IT, but I worked in the gastronomy industry for a long time.  
At the age of forty, however, I decided to make a dream come true: to work professionally with IT, networks, and servers.

This homelab project is the first step on that path: I am building a real, working test environment on my own budget and in my free time, in order to gain hands-on experience in system and network administration.

This is not a perfectly sterile lab, but rather a fine worked, dynamically evolving learning platform, with its own mistakes, solutions, and documentation.

---

## My goal with this project is to

- demonstrate my progress,
- build a stable, remotely accessible, container-based home service platform that also serves as a learning environment,
- help other beginners who are starting a similar journey, and
- convince my future employer that they are dealing with a motivated, eager-to-learn, and practical-minded person.

**Itâ€™s never too late to change direction â€“ the only thing that matters is that you take the first step.**

## ðŸ§  About TrustMindLab

This repository is not only a documentation archive â€” it is a **personal DevSecOps sandbox**, where I work on:

- zero-trust networking concepts  
- secure remote access strategies  
- Debian-based headless router configurations  
- pfSense and firewall optimization  
- logging, monitoring, and automated incident response  
- Docker and container hardening  
- VPN & subnet routing (Tailscale, etc.)  
- Homelab automation, scripts, and cron jobs  

I document everything I build and test â€” including missteps, debugging processes, insights, and solutions. Every script, markdown, or log analysis here reflects real work done on real hardware, under real conditions.

| `docs/cheatsheet/` | Short practical references and command summaries |
| `docs/pfsense/` | Firewall, filtering and network monitoring guides |
| `assets/`      | Screenshots, diagrams, and visual documentation |
| `docs/scripts/`| Scripts, CRON jobs, and helper tools |
| `docs/studies/`| Smaller experiments and tests |
| `docs/humor/`  | Lighthearted insights (yes, this is important too!) |

## ðŸ“£ Final words

This lab is **not a showcase â€” itâ€™s a journey.**  
If you're reading this, you're already part of it.  

And if you're building something similar:  
**Donâ€™t wait for permission. Build. Break. Fix. Document. Repeat.**
